# python-backup-utility
A utility to backup files and folders

We take as input the source and destination from the user, and create a backup. The source may be either a:
  1. File
  2. Folder

Moreover, the user has the option to specify a list of : 
    1. files
    2. folders
    3. extensions 
that he wishes to ignore. These would not be included in the backup.
