Backend: 


We take as input the source and destination from the user, and create a backup. The source may be either a:
  1. File
  2. Folder

Moreover, the user has the option to specify a list of :
  1. Files
  2. Folders
  3. Extensions 
that he wishes to ignore. These would not be included in the backup.
